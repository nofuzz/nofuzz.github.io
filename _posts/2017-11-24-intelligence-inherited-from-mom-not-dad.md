According to genetics studies, the intelligence is derived from the female X chromosome. It means that the mother's genetics determines how clever her children are, while the fathers make no difference. Reason? It's because the woman is more likely to transmit intelligence genes because the're carried out on the X chromosome, that the woman has two. The doctors believed that both the parents contribute equally to their child's intelligence. While scientists now believe in the following explanation: " the genes which are responsible for advanced cognitive functions that are inherited from the father are possibly automatically deactivated. The activated genes have an impact on genetic development and the deactivated genes don't. If there is a single characteristic which is affected via the mother, the father genes will automatically get deactivated. If a single characteristic is affected via the father, the maternal genes are later deactivated. "There is a category of genes, called the " conditioned genes " that are thought to work only if they come from the mother or from the father. The study we're talking about makes us believe totally that intelligence is in the genes which come from the mother.Normally, it is about 40 to 60 % that is hereditary from our parents, the rest is what we learn and we take from the environment and nurture. We owe our mothers a lot because they are the reason we have an intelligence.
